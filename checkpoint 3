//FizzBuzz
//Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

//If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
//If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
//If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
//Otherwise, just print the number.

//Hints:
//You can check whether one number is a multiple of another by using .isMultiple(of:). For example, i.isMultiple(of: 3).
//In this instance you need to check for 3 and 5 first because it’s the most specific, then 3, then 5, and finally have an else block to handle all other numbers.
//You can either use && to check for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, or have a nested if statement.
//You need to count from 1 through 100, so use ... rather than ..<.

for number in 1...100 {
    var textToPrint = ""

    if number.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        textToPrint = "Fizz"
    }

    if number.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        textToPrint += "Buzz"
    }

    if(textToPrint == "") {
        textToPrint = "\(number)"
    }

    print(textToPrint)
}
